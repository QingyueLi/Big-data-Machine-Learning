# Day1

We discussed that how the camera could catch up the data and use these data to create their own function. We learned something about the supervised learning, which is already given the x (explanatory variable) and y (response variable) data set. We explored the y variable more. For the respone variable, it can be divided into continous data and discrete data.  
- Continous data is measured out, from crtain range, we can have any number. The exmaple for this could be the temperature. 
- Discrete data is counted, finite possibility. The example could lbe the numbers of cats VS dogs. Something (defination of number) that can't be divided. 

We also talked about two stages for Pipeline:
- First stage is to collection dataï¼Œwhich is the x variable and use that data to explore the function (model). We could get the educated guess based on the function we found. 
- Second stage is put the function that already made in the software product and punish to the community to collect new data.
